This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(lubridate)
library(recoder)
```

## Load the data 
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("D:/Fredrik/Data Science/R/R Data/1 Coursera data/4. Reproduceable research")
getwd()
list.files()

d<-read.csv("activity.csv", header=T, sep=",")
head(d)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_per_day<-group_by(d, date) %>%
  summarise(stepsperday=sum(steps, na.rm=T))
d_per_day
```
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
g<-ggplot(data=d_per_day,aes(stepsperday))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20, fill="green",color="black")+
  labs(title="Steps per day", x="Steps", y="Frequency")+
  ylim(0,15)

print(g)
```

## Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
summary(d_per_day$stepsperday)[3:4]
```
##What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
meanstepsperinterval<- group_by(d,interval) %>%
  summarise(steps_interval=mean(steps, na.rm=T))
meanstepsperinterval

```

## Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}

i<-ggplot(meanstepsperinterval, aes(interval,steps_interval))+
  geom_line(fill="green")+labs(title="Average steps per interval", x="Interval", y="Steps")
print(i)
```

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}

maxsteps<-max(meanstepsperinterval$steps_interval)
max<-filter(meanstepsperinterval,steps_interval==maxsteps)
print(round(max),0)
```

## Imputing missing values
## Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
## checking all three columns

```{r}

for(i in 1:length(d)){
  print(names(d)[i], quote = F)
  print(table(is.na(d[,i])))
}

```

## Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
## The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day,
## for the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

## subsetting out rows with missing

```{r}
dmiss<-filter(d, is.na(steps))
dnomiss<-filter(d, !is.na(steps))
```

```{r}

d_imputed<-left_join(dmiss, meanstepsperinterval, by = "interval")%>% # add mean steps per interval for missing
mutate(steps=steps_interval)%>% # add mean steps per interval for missing into variable steps
select(-steps_interval)%>%  # Drop steps_interval, which is not needed anymore
rbind(dnomiss)%>%       # row bind imputed rows with rows with no missing
arrange(date,interval)      # Sort data after date and interval

```

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day with imputed data
## re-arrange data in order to make a chart

```{r}
stepsperdayimputed<-group_by(d_imputed, date)%>%
  summarise(stepsperday=sum(steps))
stepsperdayimputed

g2<-ggplot(data=stepsperdayimputed,aes(stepsperday))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20, fill="red",color="black")+
  labs(title="Steps per day imputed values", x="Steps", y="Frequency")+
  ylim(0,15)

print(g2)

```

## Compare histograms
```{r}
print(grid.arrange(g, g2, nrow = 1, ncol = 2))


maxstepsimp<-max(stepsperdayimputed$stepsperday)
maximp<-filter(stepsperdayimputed,stepsperday==maxsteps)
print(round(max),0)

#Print median and mean
summary(stepsperdayimputed$stepsperday)[3:4] #Print median and mean
```

##  What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

## FA comment: The shape gets more to the shape of a normal distribution, with mean equal to median

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

## Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" 
## indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
## Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
## and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 
## See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.


#Create factors 

```{r}

d$date <- ymd(as.character(d$date))

d$weekday <- weekdays(d$date) #calculate weekday

#calculate weekday or weekend
d$weekday[d$weekday == "måndag"] <- "weekday"
d$weekday[d$weekday == "tisdag"] <- "weekday"
d$weekday[d$weekday == "onsdag"] <- "weekday"
d$weekday[d$weekday == "torsdag"] <- "weekday"
d$weekday[d$weekday == "fredag"] <- "weekday"
d$weekday[d$weekday == "lördag"] <- "weekend"
d$weekday[d$weekday == "söndag"] <- "weekend"

weekday <- filter(d, weekday == "weekday")
weekend <- filter(d, weekday == "weekend")

weekday <- group_by(weekday, interval) %>%
  summarise(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))


weekend <- group_by(weekend, interval) %>%
  summarise(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

weekday_plot <- ggplot(data = weekday, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  ylim(0,235) +
  labs(title = "Weekday") +
  labs(y = "Average Steps per 5 minutes interval") +
  labs(x = "Minutes during the day")

weekend_plot <- ggplot(data = weekend, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  ylim(0,235) +
  labs(title = "Weekend") +
  labs(y = "Average Steps per 5 minutes interval") +
  labs(x = "Minutes during the day")

print(grid.arrange(weekday_plot, weekend_plot, nrow = 2, ncol = 1))

```
